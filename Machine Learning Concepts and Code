'''
There are many types of regression models used to test relationships/trends between variables 

Linear Regression: Used to compare variables to test for a trend. Typically using an indepedent and dependent variable. 

'''

#Running linear regression in python 

#import required packages 
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import linear_model

#Open and read CSV file for Data 
#Or use other form of Data imported into python

data = pd.read_csv(##CSV FILE NAME HERE)
data.head() #Test that it is imported and reading correctly

#Pick which variables from the data you wish to compare

data = data[["##IV VARIABLE NAME", "##DV VARIABLE NAME"]]

# Use visualizations to plot the data to look for trends in the variables 
plt.scatter(data["##IV"] , data["##DV"] , color = "blue") 
plt.xlabel("##IV") 
plt.ylabel("##DV")
plt.show() 

# Using Machine Learning to test and train the regression model for accuracy 
train =  data[:(int((len(data)*0.8)))]
test= data[(int((len(data)*0.8))):]

# the 0.8 in the formula means we are using 80% of the data for testing 
# If the file is large it might be a good idea to use less
